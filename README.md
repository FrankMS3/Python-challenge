# Python-challenge
Using Python to analyse two datasets: a company's financial records and polling data

Running either of the main.py files, located in both the PyBank and PyPoll folders, will print an analysis of the respective .csv dataset (found in the Resources folders) to the terminal, and will also export this analysis to a new .txt file, located in the respective Analysis folder.
